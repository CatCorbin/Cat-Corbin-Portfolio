    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Caybree but I go by Cat. My parents started calling me Cat when I was young, probably because I am such a cat person. All growing up I new that I was interested in the tech industry but didn't know quite which area to persue. After speaking with a friend who had gotten into software engineering, I became very interested in that expertise because of all of the different but very cool things you can do with it. I am currently a student at the University of Utah and am knee deep in a coding bootcamp to further my skills. Keep coming back to this portfolio to see all the neat pages I make in the future!</p>

    <h2>Study Guide</h2>
    <p>When I had little to no prior experiencewith coding, I created a study guide to coding as a prework project before starting my coding bootcamp. This webpage included HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and was deployed to the web.</p>

    <h2>Client Site</h2>
    <p>Still being very new to web developement, I was given a starter code and created a website for a client using HTML and CSS only. This website includes a working navigation tab that when clicked will take the user to a specifc area of the page, pictures, and links. Check the page out with the link below!
