# <Cat-Corbin-Portfolio>

## Description

As a student going into the web developement field, I built a portfolio to store previous projects to showcase potential employers or individuals wanting to work with me. This portfolio will continuously be updated as I become more advanced and will therefore showcase my work as a beginner and show my growth throughout the following months.
